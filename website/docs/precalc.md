# Precalc Data

Precalc is all about calculating expensive spatial metrics ahead of time.

When you run the precalc script it starts a local web server on port 8001 that serves up the datasources in `data/dist`.

The precalc script then gets all your project datasources with `precalc: true`, and all your project geographies with `precalc: true`, and then calculate `area`, `sum`, and `count` metrics for each combination of datasource and geography.

Once complete `project/precalc.json` is updated with the new values.

Tips:

- You have to re-run `precalc:data` every time you change a geography or datasource.
- Set `precalc:false` for datasources that are not currently used, or are only used to define a geography (not displayed in reports). This is why the datasource for the default geography for a project is always set by default to `precalc: false`.
- If you are using one of the [global-datasources](https://github.com/seasketch/global-datasources) in your project, and you want to use it in reporting % sketch overlap, so you've set `precalc:true`, strongly consider defining a `bboxFilter`. This will ensure that precalc doesn't have to fetch the entire datasource when precalculating a metric, which can be over 1 Gigabyte in size. Also consider setting a `propertyFilter` to narrow down to just the features you need. This filter is applied on the client-side so it won't reduce the number of features you are sending over the wire.

#### Precalc Data Cleanup

If you remove a geography/datasource, then in order to remove their precalculated metrics from `precalc.json`, you will need to run the cleanup command.

```bash
npm run precalc:data:cleanup
```
